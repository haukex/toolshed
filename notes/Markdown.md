My Notes on Markdown
====================

[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (GFM) is a strict superset of
[CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/).

According to <https://github.com/github/markup?tab=readme-ov-file#markups>,
GitHub itself uses [Commonmarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker),
which is actually just a wrapper of [Comrak](https://hrzn.ee/kivikakk/comrak#comrak-https-hrzn-ee-kivikakk-comrak).
(which in turn states it is a "Rust port of [github's `cmark-gfm`](https://github.com/github/cmark)",
however, the latter currently *appears* unmaintained to me).
