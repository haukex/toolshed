My Notes on Python
==================

In this directory, `requirements.txt` is not the list of requirements
for this project, instead it is my notes on all the Python modules
I find interesting / useful.

Installing Python on Linux
--------------------------

    sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev libgdbm-dev libgdbm-compat-dev \
        libc6-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev uuid-dev lzma-dev liblzma-dev libffi-dev tk-dev libncurses5-dev
    sudo apt-get build-dep python3 idle-python3.11
    
    umask 022
    sudo mkdir -v /opt/python3.11.2
    sudo chown -c `id -u`:`id -g` /opt/python3.11.2
    
    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.2/Python-3.11.2.tar.xz
    tar xJvf Python-3.11.2.tar.xz
    
    cd Python-3.11.2
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/python3.11.2 --enable-optimizations
    make && make test && make install
    
    sudo ln -snfv /opt/python3.11.2 /opt/python3
    
    # in ~/.profile:
    test -d /opt/python3 && PATH="/opt/python3/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}"
    
    which python3
    which pip3
    which idle3
    python3 --version
    
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel
    # see requirements.txt for how to install those
    
    # to add something to PYTHONPATH in .profile:
    export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/code/igbdatatools${PYTHONPATH:+:${PYTHONPATH}}"
    
    # https://docs.python.org/3/download.html
    wget https://docs.python.org/3/archives/python-3.11.2-docs-html.tar.bz2
    tar xjvf python-3.11.2-docs-html.tar.bz2
    mv python-3.11.2-docs-html /opt/python3/html
    find /opt/python3/html -type d -exec chmod 755 '{}' + -o -exec chmod 644 '{}' +

If building on an old Ubuntu LTS like 18.04 (bionic), see <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98973>:
the `./configure` step needs to be prefixed with `TCLTK_LIBS="-ltk8.6 -ltcl8.6" TCLTK_CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/tcl8.6"`
for tkinter to work (look for `checking for stdlib extension module _tkinter... yes`)

An alternative I haven't tested yet: <https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa>
(`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`)

Windows Notes
-------------

During install, I usually choose `autocrlf=input`.

Getting `python3` to reference `python` on Win 10 (because `python3.exe`
opens the Store), shown from Git Bash:

    rm "$HOME/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/python3.exe"
    cd "$HOME/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python311/"
    cp python.exe python3.exe

In Windows 10, environment variables can be added for the current user via the
Control Panel, in User Accounts you can find a setting "Change my environment
variables", or you can press Windows+R and then enter:

    rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables

To apply execute permissions to files on Windows:

    git ls-files --stage
    git update-index --chmod=+x <filenames>

Python Versions
---------------

Some of the reasons I require the latest Python versions:

- Python 3.10
  - newer typing features like union type operator
  - `zip(..., strict=True)` (`more_itertools.zip_equal` has been deprecated)
  - `PYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING`
- Python 3.11
  - `datetime.fromisoformat` is more flexible (e.g. supports trailing `Z`)
  - `contextlib.chdir`
  - `typing.Self`
  - Python 3.11.1 for `http.server` security updates
- Python 3.12
  - `NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True, delete_on_close=False)`
